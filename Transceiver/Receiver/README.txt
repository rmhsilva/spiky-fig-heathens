The clippingsim images are to demonstrate that the clipping of an upconverted signal does not significantly affect the phase information.
The amount of clipping was set to the equivalent which would occur in our system if a -50dBm signal is injected, i.e. approximately 145% of full swing.
The test baseband signal created is sin(1.2*pi*t) + j*cos(0.9*pi*t). This signal was generated to intentionally give the phase angle output observed to demonstrate how little the clipping affects the phase.

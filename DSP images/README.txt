This folder contains screenshots from Matlab to include in the report when talking about the DSP development.
Within the signal processing sub-folders, the simulations are only concerning one aspect of DSP in isolation, i.e. the combined effect is not considered.
The simulation results folder provides BER vs SNR curves for when all modules are connected.
The file names should make it clear as to what test was done.
